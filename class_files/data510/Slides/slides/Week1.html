<h2>So what is a Capstone?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A culmination project meant to demonstrate and showcase your mastery
in the core areas of data science:
<ul>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Data visualization and presentation</li>
<li>Data engineering</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A capstone project should embody <em>all</em> of those aspects and
synthesize them into a cohesive and compelling narrative</li>
<li>Projects will be done in small groups of 2-3, assigned by
myself</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="but-wait-theres-more" class="slide level2">
<h2>But wait, there’s more!</h2>
<ul>
<li>Gotta get a job (or keep your options open)</li>
<li>There is a lot that entails:
<ul>
<li>Understanding what you want to do</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Marketing yourself</li>
<li>Interviewing</li>
<li>Professional conduct</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While not technical skills, these skills can be just important for
actually landing a position as technical skills</li>

<h2>The Capstone Class</h2>
<ul>
<li>This class will fundamentally stand on two legs:
<ul>
<li>Professional development</li>
<li>Creation and presentation of a capstone project</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bonus: Being aware and able to discuss the current trends and news
in the data science industry</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="objectives" class="slide level2">

<p>Upon conclusion, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate the job market and leverage your skills and talents in job
searches and job interviews</li>
<li>Advertise yourself to potential employers, showcasing your past
work</li>
<li>Plan out and execute a large, extended research project, meeting
deadlines along the way</li>

<h2>Professional Development</h2>
<ul>
<li>Approximately every other week Ruthie will be visiting and running
the first half of class to focus on various professional development
skills
<ul>
<li>The goal is to have you as prepared as possible as your apply for
jobs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Several rounds of mock interviews over the course of the
semester</li>
<li>Not currently looking for a new job? <strong>This still
applies</strong>
<ul>
<li>The tech job market is a rapidly evolving beast, and the vast
majority of tech-workers switch job multiple times over their career.
Even if not immediately applicable to you, it almost assuredly will be
at some point.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Credit/no credit given for accomplishing the in-class activities.
<ul>
<li>Miss a week? You are responsible for getting the content and
completing the activities, and showing them to me.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ruthie will start visiting us next week</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="github-pages-portfolio" class="slide level2">
<h2>GitHub Pages Portfolio</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need a publically visible location to market yourself and
showcase your talents and past work</li>
<li>Should be polished and informative</li>
<li>Many ways this could be done, but hosting a site on GitHub Pages is
probably the most straightforward method to get up and running
<ul>
<li>Many templates available so that you don’t need a ton of front-end
knowledge to make something nice</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Blogs are a method of raising your personal brand, and such pages
can also serve as a platform for that sort of writing if you are
interested.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="project-milestones" class="slide level2">
<h2>Project Milestones</h2>
<ul>
<li>The capstone project is a large project that extends over multiple
months, which is outside the typical student scheduling and organizing
sweet spot.</li>
<li>As such we have provided about one goal a month to ensure that you
are staying on track and to help with your planning and scheduling
<ul>
<li>End of May: Project Proposal</li>
<li>End of June: Data Summary</li>
<li>End of July: Rough draft of write-up</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="milestones-project-proposal" class="slide level2">
<h2>Milestones: Project Proposal</h2>
<ul>
<li>A short write-up that details all of the planned ideas and steps
that will bring the project to fruition
<ul>
<li>What is your central research question?</li>
<li>Where are you going to get your data from, and have you confirmed
that is possible?</li>
<li>What statistics would you be looking at to help answer and provide
confidence in your research question?</li>
<li>How will you be incorporating some aspect of machine learning into
the project?</li>
<li>What general visuals would you imagine using to demonstrate your
findings?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While a proposal does not lock you in stone, it is an efficient
roadmap. Deviating from it should only be done when unexpected things
happen, as doing so is generally going to add time or other
complications. The better you design the proposal, the more likely
things will go smoothly.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="milestones-data-summary" class="slide level2">
<h2>Milestones: Data Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>June is to be data aquisition month, and upon the end of June you
are expected to have your data largely in hand</li>
<li>If collecting live data, you should have your pipelines up and
running and transforming data automatically into something immediately
useful</li>
<li>If collecting static data, you should have it all gathered and
modeled/organized into tables for easy access</li>
<li>Your data should be replicated on at <em>least</em> two devices</li>
<li>Past this point, you should not need to be devoting time and effort
to your data collection.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="aside-data-sources" class="slide level2">
<h2>Aside: Data Sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing the same data as everyone else for new insights is very
difficult</li>
<li>Far better to leverage a data collection that is unique and curated
by you</li>
<li>The data that you collect and use for your capstone project should
be data that is unique to your project.
<ul>
<li>That might mean that you scrape or pull together data that hasn’t
been compiled before</li>
<li>That might mean that you pull from many large datasets to construct
an amalgamated dataset that has not been compiled before.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Want a project that makes you marketable? Stay away from Kaggle or
similar sites for primary data sources.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="milestones-rough-draft-of-write-up" class="slide level2">
<h2>Milestones: Rough Draft of Write-up</h2>
<ul>
<li>The project write-up will be a web publication detailing your
research question, your data, your methodology, and your
conclusions.</li>
<li>This rough draft should already include sections on all the projects
main requirements.</li>
<li>Going from the rough draft to the final draft should be about
fine-tuning and clarifying, <em>not</em> adding significant
content.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="final-presentation" class="slide level2">
<h2>Final Presentation!</h2>
<ul>
<li>The combined cohorts will present their projects on the last day of
class, here in Portland</li>
<li>You will have 15 minutes (12 + 3 for questions) to convey your
project to an audience of your peers, faculty, and industry
professionals.</li>
<li>12 minutes is <strong>not</strong> enough time to go into all the
details of a 3-month project, so you need to prioritize and constrain
yourself to telling the best story.</li>
<li>Should be professional in appearance, delivery, and
presentation.</li>
<li>You <strong>must</strong> be present on this day. Put it on your
calendar now.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="final-draft" class="slide level2">
<h2>Final Draft</h2>
<ul>
<li>Builds on the rough draft</li>
<li>Extensively proofread and polished
<ul>
<li>Text and visuals should be as good as you can make them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Published online and linked or otherwise connected to student’s
portfolios</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="check-ins" class="slide level2">
<h2>Check-ins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even monthly milestones can be a long time to plan</li>
<li>It helps to remain cognizant and introspective of what you should be
doing so that things do not fall by the wayside</li>
<li>Every weekend, there will be a check-in form available
<ul>
<li>Should take less than 5 mins to complete</li>
<li>Asks questions like:
<ul>
<li>What was accomplished the previous week?</li>
<li>Rate how productive your group was over the previous week.</li>
<li>What are the plans for the upcoming week?</li>
<li>Where are you currently at in meeting the monthly milestone?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Scored credit/no-credit and ONLY available Sat-Mon, so remember to
fill them out!</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="late-policy" class="slide level2">
<h2>Late Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>The milestones are not recommendations, they are deadlines</li>
<li>For each milestone you have a 24hr grace period that you can submit
it without penalty.</li>
<li>Past that it is 20% off each day.</li>
<li>The final presentation and check-ins are exempt from this policy and
must be completed on time for credit.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="questions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Questions?!</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’ve been thinking about this a ton and have tried to get it all
down here, but there are probably some things I have forgotten. What
questions can I answer?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="research-questions-vs-eda" class="slide level2">
<h2>Research Questions vs EDA</h2>
<ul>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis != Research Question</li>
<li>EDA might inform how you approach a research question, but
<strong>it is not the question (or the answer)</strong></li>
<li>A research question needs to:
<ul>
<li>Be clear and focused</li>
<li>Address a particular problem</li>
<li>Be empirically answerable with credible sources</li>
<li>Be complex enough to merit a detailed answer (just yes/no probably
isn’t enough)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<li>Often begin with: how, why, what, and which</li>
<li>Are interesting to others</li>

<h2>Brainstorm Speed Dating!</h2>
<div style="font-size:.9em">
<ul>
<li>The key to starting any good project is to think of a topic you’d be
interested in answering a question in</li>
<li>There are a <strong>huge</strong> number of possible topics with
data science implications</li>
<li>Using the back row of tables, I need 3 people sitting on each side
facing one another (6 on each)</li>
<li>If you are facing the front of the room, you will move each
round</li>
<li>If you are facing the back, you will be handed a stack of 12 cards.
<strong>Do not reorder them.</strong></li>
<li>Each round, flip over the top card. Then you have 6 minutes to
brainstorm with your partner as many ideas as possible around that
theme</li>
<li>After 6 minutes are up, I’ll give you one minute to write down any
last thoughts you have and then movers will move one position to their
left (wrapping around)</li>
