## Announcements
- Some structural parts of the course are _still_ (ugh) coming together, and should be up by the end of the week.
    - Website
    - Canvas page
- I'm done with everything else now though, so this has all my attention!
- From you:
    - Just under 2 weeks until project proposal is due!

# Professional Development Time!

# Break Time

# Group Preliminaries 

## Project Workbook
- To help communication and clarity, you'll have a central GitHub repository for all your working content over the semester
- This can be created by following the link [here]()
    - These are by team, so if you are the first to accept, please make a team name with you and your partners first names. If you are the second to accept, just join the correct team.
- These repos are private to you (and me). We will make other public repos later for sharing.
- I will ask that milestone materials are uploaded to this repository each month, so keep it organized
- We'll touch next week on how to stay synched with a repository when two people can be affecting it


## Project Management
- There are a few things that should always be tracked on large projects:
    - Deadlines
    - What currently needs to be done (prioritize!)
    - What currently is being worked on
    - Who is working on what
- All of this can actually be tracked through GitHub's projects interface!
    - This is tied to your shared repository (though you can link to it externally)
- As part of the weekly check-ins, the expectation is that you will keep these current and up-to-date


## Chartering
- Effective teamwork is all about communication, and it pays dividends to align your expectations early
- Components of alignment include:
    - Shared simple rules: defining the values and rules of the team, including working agreements.
    - Team skills assessment: identify areas and expertises of the team and any potential gaps
    - Team interests and preferences: identify topics that make team members excited, and how team members prefer to work
- A charter is _written down_, so that it is crystal clear and members can refer back to it later as needed.


## Defining Simple Rules
- What can each member do to create a positive experience for all?
- What are ways you can build team cohesion?
- How will you make decisions?
    - How can your rules help you make decisions?
- Conflict management: what happens if rules are broken?
- How do you decide when something is "done"? How do you define "done"?

## Skill Assessment
- You all share some background from this program, but also have your own unique backgrounds! So think critically and share:
    - What things do you think you are particularly strong at?
    - What types of tasks do you enjoy doing?
    - What things do you think you are weaker at, or less excited by?
    - Are there requirements of this project that you both feel weaker in? How can you prepare for and manage those portions of the project?
    - How can you distribute work in a way that plays best to member's strengths and preferences?


## Communication
- You will always have this class to check-in with one another during the week (if you both are present)
- Beyond that, how often will you check in with one another during the week?
- What form will that check-in take? Text? Video chat? In-person?
- Specifically what do you want these check-ins to cover? Progress reports? Planning?

# Group Work

## Group Assignments
- Given your input, these are the groups I ended up putting together:
    - Maile and Alaina
    - Frances and Haleigh
    - Anna and Nick
    - Jake and Stephane
    - Leann and Kass
    - Christy and Jonathan

## Tonight
- For the remainder of the evening, you have the following tasks to accomplish with your partner, in the following order of priority:
    - Accept and create the project workbook repository
    - Create a project within the repository, so that you can start tracking and assigning tasks
    - Create a markdown file called `Charter.md` and within it delineate the simple rules of your team, your skill assessments, and your communication strategy
    - Start brainstorming and researching topics!
        - Start big, and get more specific: all groups are starting with at least 1 major topic of shared interest, but you may deviate or come up with others
        - Think about the interesting question you want to answer first, and THEN think about how or if you can apply all the necessary themes.
        - **Write things down!** Even ideas that you abandon.


## For next week:
- You have check-ins this week! Watch the Discord announcements for the posted link
- Make sure that you have tasks created and populated in the GitHub project board for what you and your partner are doing/working on over the coming week
