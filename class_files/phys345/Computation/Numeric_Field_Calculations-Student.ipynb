In many cases, the source charge distributions can be complicated to the point where the math for calculating these fields can become daunting or downright impossible. In these situations, our only method of determining these fields may be to do so numerically. Today we will work through the process necessary to numerically calculate an electric field and corresponding potential from an arbitrary initial charge distribution.\n",

Instead, we can take an image that already has that information encoded into it in the form of color! (Or in this case, shades of gray.)
