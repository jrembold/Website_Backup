## The Big Picture
![Storage and Retrieval Island](../images/ch3_island.png){width=60%}


## Why so technical?
> "On a most fundamental level, a database needs to do two things: when you give it some data, it should store the data, and when you ask it again later, it should give the data back to you"

- Why should a data engineer care about the ins and outs of database storage and retrieval?
  - **Not** so you can try to design better storage systems from scratch
  - _So you can choose a storage engine to match your needs_
    - A real focus here is on knowing just enough of the field and terminology so that you could make informed decisions and understand documentation that might help you make those decisions.


## A case of indexing
- Writing data to storage and reading the data back from storage frequently have very different needs
- Most methods will enact tradeoffs between the two
  - Storing something quickly will likely make it more difficult to find later
    - Example: Tossing a book into an empty spot on your bookcase
  - Storing something so that it can be quickly found likely takes longer
    - Example: Placing your book in the alphabetically correct location by author
- Using an _index_ will generally assist with retrieval, but costs time on writes to update the index
  - Often only some columns will be indexed for fast retrieval


## Beavers Love them
::::::cols
::::col
- A _log_ in a database sense is an **append-only** sequence of records
- Updated records just have new values assigned later in the log
- Most recent entries to the log have priority
::::

::::col
![A Log](../images/db_log.png)

::::
::::::


## #Hash Indexing
- Stores key-value pairs, where the key is used to determine a _hash_
- Imagine a hash as a sign that says: "Look right here for this value"
- Log of transactions and values are stored on disk, but the hash-map is stored in memory
- When a log gets too large, a new one is started and the old log is compacted
  - New log segment gets a new hash-map in memory
  - Logs are later merged to further compact them
- Pros: sequential writes are good! Crash recovery is simple
- Cons: All the hash maps need to fit in memory. Range queries inefficient


## SSTables
- Still a form of log, so append-only
- Keys are stored in segments in sorted order

![Example SSTable structure$^1$](../images/sstable.png)


## LSM-Tree: Writing
- A _log-structure merge-tree_ stores new writes initially in a _memtable_
- The memtable is really a tree structure that sorts the keys as they come in
- When the tree gets too large, the keys are flushed to a new SSTable on disk

![LSM to SSTable$^1$](../images/lsm_to_sstable.png){width=70%}

## LSM-Tree: Reading
- Would normally still look for a corresponding key in the most recent segment
- Segments can often use an in-memory _sparse index_ that takes advantage of the ordered state of the keys for faster look-ups

![Improving finding speed with a sparse index$^1$](../images/sparse_index.png)


## LSM Cost/Benefit
- Pros
  - Faster look-ups owing to ordered keys
  - Not all keys need to exist in memory
  - Works very well for write-heavy situations, as it only performs sequential writes (which require less disk scanning)
- Cons
  - A crash would lose all the data currently in the memtable that hasn't been written to an SSTable
    - Can also keep an unordered hash table log on disk of all writes whose only existence is to restore the memtable in case of crash
  - Searching for files not in the database still takes a long time as all segments must be searched
    - Using _bloom filters_ can help by immediately reporting if the key is not in the database


## B-Trees
- Most widely used storage architecture
- Constrains segments of key-value pairings by size (often around 4 KB)
- Keys can either point to the value in memory, or they can point to another segment
  - Segments pointing to other segments is where the tree structure comes in


## B-Tree Look-up
![Showing the structure and looking up a key in a B-Tree](../images/b-tree-loopup.png){width=80%}

## B-Tree Writing
- The tree is traversed and the key is attempted to be found
  - If it is, the reference to the value is change **in place**
  - If not, the key and value are added to that correct segment
- If a segment is full (fixed size remember), then it is split into two new segments, each half full.
  - This also forces the parent segment to need to be updated (and possibly split)


## B-Tree Cost/Benefit
- Pros
  - Most values can be accessed in less than 4 segments, making for **very fast read speeds**
    - Also leads to more predictable response times
  - Store each key in only one location, so less chance of competing processes getting confused
- Cons
  - Crashes mid-write can be highly problematic
    - Often keeps a _write-ahead log_ of what is going to be done in case of crash, but this doubles the amount to be written
  - More easily fragment as a result of small amounts of space left between segments


## Different Use Cases
- Large-scale differences in how databases will be used
- OLTP: Online Transaction Processing
- OLAP: Online Analytic Processing

![View of a typical pipeline](../images/oltp_vs_olap.png){width=50%}


## Transaction vs Analytics

| Property    | Transaction Processing (OLTP)                | Analytic Processing (OLAP)              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Read trend  | Small number of records per query            | Aggregate over large numbers of records |
| Write trend | Random-access, low latency writes from users | Bulk import (ELT)                       |
| Used by     | End user or customers                        | Internal analyst                        |
| Represents  | Latest state of data                         | History of data events                  |
| Sizes       | Gigabytes to terabytes                       | Terabytes to petabytes                  |


## Analytic Processing
::::::cols
::::col
- Needs to focus on handling huge queries and aggregates
  - Relational databases a good fit for this
- Frequently end up with "star" or "snowflake" type schematics
  - One central fact table with other surrounding tables containing details
::::

::::col
![A simple star schema](../images/star_schema.png)

::::
::::::

## Analytic Optimizations
- Column-data stored together
  - As opposed to OLTP solutions, where data from a row is stored together
  - Most analysis looks at a single column over all rows, so this makes reads faster
- Compressing column data as bitmaps
  - Makes boolean searches very speedy, as binary arithmetic can be used
- Computing _data cubes_
  - Pre-computing common (and computationally heavy) aggregates in their own table

<section id="remote-sessions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Remote Sessions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>An extremely useful aspect of working in a shell is the
simplicity with which you can connect to other remote systems</p></li>
<li><p>The program usually used to do so is called
<code class="pgsql">ssh</code>, standing for “secure shell”</p></li>
<li><p>To log into a remote server, the command looks something
like:</p>
<pre ><code class="bash">ssh {user name}@{ip address or domain name}</code></pre>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="bash">user name</code> is your user name on the
<em>remote</em> server (which may be different than your local
name)</li>
<li><code class="bash">ip address or domain name</code> is either the
direct ip address of the server (eg. 165.213.13.194) or the domain name
(myserver.net)</li>
<li>Some servers may require a special port as well, which can be
indicated with <code class="pgsql">-p</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="working-remotely" class="slide level2">
<h2>Working Remotely</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upon remote connection to a server, you will just end up in another
shell, usually another Bash shell</li>
<li>This is where being comfortable in a shell can really shine!
<ul>
<li>Anything you could normally do in a shell, you can do here instead,
but it happens on the remote system</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When you are done, you can type <code class="bash">exit</code> to
leave the remote connection and return to your local shell
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to your shell prompts! It is easy to get confused of
if you are on the remote server or on your local system!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="executing-commands-directly" class="slide level2">
<h2>Executing commands directly</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>If you just need to run a quick command on the remote system, you
can do so directly from <code class="pgsql">ssh</code></p></li>
<li><p>Simply add the desired command as the last
<code class="pgsql">ssh</code> argument</p>
<pre ><code class="bash">ssh username@server mycommand</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>This runs the command on the remote server, but then gets the stdout
and brings it back to be displayed in your local stdout</li>
<li>This means you could then pipe <em>that</em> output into a program
that only exists locally on your system to further process the
data!</li>

<section id="streamlining-security" class="slide level2">
<h2>Streamlining Security</h2>
<ul>
<li>Entering in your account password each time isn’t onerous but can be
inconvenient
<ul>
<li>It makes it impossible to schedule automatic tasks that would
connect to a server, for instance</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Instead of a password, you can take advantage of an <em>ssh
key</em>, which uses a public/private key authentication system
<ul>
<li>You generate (or use an existing) public and private key pair on
your system</li>
<li>You upload the public key to the server you want to be able to
connect to</li>
<li>The private key always stays only on your system. It is not
shared!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="using-keys" class="slide level2">
<h2>Using Keys</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>To create a new key, you can use</p>
<pre ><code class="bash" style="font-size:.9em">ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C {desc comment}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>You will be asked for a passphrase for the key. You can go without
and the key will still be much more secure than most password systems,
but you could also add a passphrase necessary to “unlock” the key</li>
<li>Two files will be created inside your
<code class="pgsql">.ssh</code> folder in your home directory: one with
just <code class="pgsql">id_ed25519</code> and one with
<code class="pgsql">id_ed25519.pub</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To copy the public key over to the desired server:</p>
<pre ><code class="bash" style="font-size:.9em">ssh-copy-id {username}@{servername}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to enter in your password one more time, but then the
key contents will be copied over</li>
</ul></li>

</section>
<section id="ssh-config" class="slide level2">
<h2>SSH Config</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Often, you are connecting to the same servers again and again</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be nice not to have to repeat information about user name,
server location, ports, etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Instead, you can set up “profiles” in your
<code class="pgsql">.ssh/config</code> file</p></li>
<li><p>A general profile entry might look something like:</p>
<pre ><code class="text">Host {profile_name}
  User {username}
  HostName {domain name or ip address}
  Port {port, if not default}</code></pre></li>

<h2>Copy That</h2>

<li>One important thing that you might frequently need to do is copy
files between your local system and remote server</li>
<li>Here you have options
<ul>
<li><p>SSH + <code class="pgsql">tee</code>: The
<code class="pgsql">tee</code> command “splits” a stream, displaying it
both to stdout and writing it to a file at the same time. You can thus
do things like:</p>
<pre ><code class="bash">cat local_file | ssh remote_server tee remote_file</code></pre>
<p>using normal pipes</p></li>
<li><p><code class="pgsql">scp</code>: The
<code class="pgsql">scp</code> command combines normal
<code class="pgsql">cp</code> and <code class="pgsql">ssh</code>,
allowing you to include a remote server in the standard format</p>
<pre ><code class="bash">scp local_file remote_server:remote_file</code></pre></li>

<h2>Sync it!</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The previous options can be nice for just copying single files,

<li><p><code class="pgsql">rsync</code> is probably your best option</p>
<pre ><code class="bash">rsync -avP local_folder/ remote_server:remote_path</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Clever about what is transferred: only copying over necessary data
that isn’t already present on the other system</li>
<li>Can maintain file/folder permissions, links, etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Common options</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="pgsql">-a</code> is for archive, and basically means:
“make a perfect copy”</li>
<li><code class="pgsql">-v</code> is for verbose, to output more
information as it is copied</li>
<li><code class="pgsql">-P</code> is for partial and progress, so that
partial transfers will resume and progress output to the screen</li>

<p>I emailed you all earlier with a server address and login
information. Use that to work through the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH into the server using your information and change your password
using <code class="pgsql">passwd</code>. Note that when you type in
passwords on most shells, they will not <strong>show anything</strong>
for security but are indeed recording what you type.</li>
<li>How many files are in your remote home directory initially? Some
might be hidden!</li>
<li>Exit out, and on your <em>local</em> system generate an SSH key.
Copy the public key over to the server. Ensure you can log in to the
server now without needing your server password!</li>

<h2>Children Processes</h2>
<ul>

launched is said to be a <em>child process</em>
<ul>
<li>This includes any program launched from the shell being a child
process of the shell itself!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When a parent program is terminated, part of a “clean” termination
involves shutting down any child processes that were spawned by the
parent
<ul>
<li>This helps prevent unnecessary or unwanted programs from continuing
to run in the background and essentially doing nothing</li>

<h1>Complicating Joins</h1>

</section>
<section id="multiple-join-conditionals" class="slide level2">
<h2>Multiple Join Conditionals</h2>
<ul>
<li>You are not limited to just a single condition in your
<code class="pgsql">ON</code> statement!</li>
<li>You can chain multiple conditions together with
<code class="pgsql">AND</code> or <code class="pgsql">OR</code>, just
like you could with <code class="pgsql">WHERE</code></li>
<li>Just recall when comparing two rows that ALL the conditions must be
true for the data to be included in the joined table</li>
</ul>
<pre ><code class="pgsql">SELECT *
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.col1 = table2.col1 
   AND table1.col2 > table2.col2;</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="table-aliases" class="slide level2">
<h2>Table Aliases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Including long table names before each column name when referring to
information from two different tables can get tedious</li>
<li>You can define aliases for table names just like you can for column
names!</li>
<li>Syntax looks just like column aliases, using
<code class="pgsql">AS</code></li>
<li>Can come immediately after you first reference a table name
<ul>
<li>Usually after a <code class="pgsql">FROM</code> or
<code class="pgsql">JOIN</code> statement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In truth, the <code class="pgsql">AS</code> is optional, but it
helps some with readability</li>
</ul>
<pre ><code class="pgsql" style="font-size:.9em">SELECT *
FROM tablename AS tn
JOIN tablename2 AS tn2
ON tn.col1 = tn2.col2;</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="multiple-joins" class="slide level2">
<h2>Multiple Joins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nothing stops you from including multiple joins in your query</li>
<li>Each additional join links back to the current growing joined table
<ul>
<li>This means a second join is treating the entire initial join as the
“left” table</li>
<li>Commonly, you’ll just be joining back to the original table, so it
won’t be apparent</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<pre ><code class="pgsql">SELECT *
FROM tablename AS t1
JOIN tablename2 AS t2 ON t1.col1 = t2.col1
JOIN tablename3 AS t3 ON t1.col2 = t3.col1;</code></pre>

<section id="more-practice" class="slide level2">
<h2>More Practice</h2>
<p><img data-src="../images/hw_assignment_schema2.png"
style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<div class="center quip">
<p>First names of all individuals who are missing at least one
assignment (no submission made)?</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="self-joins" class="slide level2">
<h2>Self Joins</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can actually join a table to itself!</li>
<li>Why would you want to do this?
<ul>
<li>Hierarchy data can frequently be explored in this fashion</li>
<li>Comparisons between rows of a table</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You <strong>need</strong> to give unique aliases when doing this, or
else you won’t have a way to distinguish between which columns you
want</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="joins-as-venn-diagrams" class="slide level2">
<h2>Joins as Venn Diagrams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it may help to think of different types of joins as Venn
diagrams</li>
</ul>
