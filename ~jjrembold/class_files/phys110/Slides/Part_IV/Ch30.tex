\begin{frame}{What is Life? \scriptsize( Baby don't hurt me?)}
  \begin{columns}
	\column{.5\textwidth}
	In beginning our search for life, we need to pin down a rather fundamental detail:
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item What constitutes life?
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item Is fire alive?
		  \item Are viruses alive?
		  \item Are there differences between organisms versus life-forms?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Life's Variety}
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Erwin Schrodinger:
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item \alert{Matter which avoids decay into equilibrium}
		\item Something which uses energy to maintain an ordered state
	  \end{itemize}
	\item NASA:
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item \alert{Self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution}
		\item Ability for reproduction with transferable mutations
	  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classic Textbook Requirements}
  \begin{center}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item \textcolor{Orange}{Order:} Molecules are arranged in orderly patterns that form cell structures
	  \item \textcolor{Orange}{Reproduction:} Living organisms are capable of reproducing (or some members are)
	  \item \textcolor{Orange}{Growth:} Living organisms grow and develop in patterns partially determined by heredity
	  \item \textcolor{Orange}{Energy:} Living organisms use energy to fuel their activities
	  \item \textcolor{Orange}{Environmental Response:} Living organisms actively respond to changes in their surroundings
	  \item \textcolor{Orange}{Adaptation:} Life evolves through some form of natural selection
	\end{itemize}
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{More a set of guidelines really\ldots}
  Looking back at viruses:
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Viruses cannot reproduce by themselves
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item They need a host to take over their cell machinery
	  \end{itemize}
	\item They have a form of structure, but not actual cell structure
	\item They don't grow, they just replicate
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item But they DO evolve
	  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{alertblock}{Life}
	Things get fuzzy real fast, so think of our rules of life more like general rules of thumb (rules of thumbs?)
  \end{alertblock}

\fullFrameImageZoomedHorizontal{ch19_waterbears.jpg}

\begin{frame}{Copernican Principle}
  \begin{itemize}
	\item We've always found ourselves wrong when assuming Earth to be special
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item Earth not center of solar system
		\item Sun not center of galaxy
		\item Nothing special about Milky Way either
	  \end{itemize}
	\item Would be surprising for life to have developed here but nowhere else
	\item The numbers by themselves would imply life developing somewhere, even if incredibly rare
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item Seem to be billions of stars in our galaxy that could have 1 or more planets
		\item Should be billions in other galaxies as well
	  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Fermi Paradox}
  \begin{columns}

	\begin{itemize}
	  \item Intelligent life has the ability to progress through technology
	  \item If intelligent life is common, where is it?
		\begin{itemize}
		  \item Life is common but intelligence is not?
		  \item Data flowing past us that we can not yet detect?
		  \item Advanced species don't interfer? (Prime Directive?)
		  \item Civilizations self destruct past a certain technology threshold?
		  \item The Dark Forest?

\begin{frame}{How could we detect life?}
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Atmospheric Gases:
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item Large amounts of oxygen may be a good indicator, but not foolproof
		\item Likely would need evidence of oxygen along with several other key gases (methane?)
		\item What other events could cause similar signatures?
		\item Earth's atmosphere only hit the needed level of oxygen 2 billion years ago. Could life have been detected the 1.5 billions years it was around before that?
	  \end{itemize}
	\item Direct observation
	  \begin{itemize}
		\item Picking up stray radio signals?
		\item Laser communications?
		\item Evidence of Dyson Sphere's?!
	  \end{itemize}

		\item Looks for signals from extraterrestrial civilizations
		\item Generally looking in both radio and optical

\begin{frame}{Except from Voyager Record}
  \begin{quotation}
	We cast this message into the cosmos. It is likely to survive a billion years into our future, when our civilization is profoundly altered\ldots If another civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these recorded contents, here is our message:

	This is a present from a small, distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope, someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.

	  \begin{itemize}
		\item $N_{HP}$: number of habitable planets
