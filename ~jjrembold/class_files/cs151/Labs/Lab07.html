<h1 id="lab-7-clicky-shrinky-box">Lab 7: Clicky Shrinky Box</h1>
<h5 id="october-1-2021">October 1, 2021</h5>
<p>Today, you will be building atop an already existing piece of code. In the template is a piece of code for constructing a simple clicky box game, wherein a box appears at a random location on the screen and, upon being clicked on, moves to a different location. Your task today will be to spruce up the game with a bit of animation. Learning goals will focus on:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Setting an interval event listener to handle animation</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Using boolean flags or conditionals to control the state of the objects in the window</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Writing a step callback to handle whatever actions are necessary at the time</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll be working in pairs again today, so check the board for your partner and location and have one of you grab the template from the link below!</p>
<p><a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/sSE3Zmjt">Repository Link</a></p>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<p>The goal for today is to add a little shrinking animation to your box whenever you click on it. Upon being clicked, the box should shrink away to nothing before reappearing in a different part of the screen, once again at its normal size. Your final product should look something like:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Shrinking_Clicky_Box.gif" alt="My example (you’ll have a white background)" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">My example (you’ll have a white background)</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="step-1">Step 1)</h4>
<p>Look over the existing code and ensure you know what parts of the code are responsible for each bit of action you see while playing the game. Commonly, a good way to “test” yourself to see if you really understand a piece of existing code is to make some alterations and predict what each will do before hand. Maybe adjust some constants or flip around an if statement. Then run your program and ensure the predicted thing indeed occurred. If something <em>different</em> occurred, then you probably need to investigate further how the code is working. Don’t settle for just a single test either. Test a few different things to really make sure you grasp what is happening. Only when you feel you confident that, should this program break, you could fix it easily, should you continue.</p>
<h4 id="part-2">Part 2)</h4>
<p>You will not be able to use the existing “click” callback to create the new box. The reason is because the first thing that happens after you click is that the clicked box shrinks, and THEN you want to create the new box. As a result, you will need to move the logic for creating the new box over to the animating step function. Don’t get rid of your “click” callback though! The difference now is that, when you click on the box, you want to indicate to the program that the box is supposed to start shrinking. To do this, you need to communicate with the <code>step()</code> function, which means you’ll need to use <code>GState</code> to pass the information between them. Right after you create the original box, add a GState variable called <code>gs.is_shrinking</code> which you can initially set to <code>False</code>. This is a little boolean “flag” that you’ll use to communicate to your step function whether the box should be shrinking or not. Now, what should happen when the square is clicked? Make the necessary fix and then move on to the <code>step</code> callback.</p>
<h4 id="part-3">Part 3)</h4>
<p>So now everything needs to happen in the <code>step</code> function, which means you need to think through what all the desired things that you could want the program to be doing. Here, you basically have 3 things to account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the box has shrunk to nothing (its size is less than 0), you want to return the box to its original size and move it to a random part of the screen. This will look very similar to parts of the original “click” callback, just don’t forget to also bring the box back to its original size.</li>
<li>If <code>is_shrinking</code> is currently <code>True</code>, then you need to be shrinking the box, which you can do by changing its width and height by a small amount each time. In order for the box to appear to shrink towards its center point, you will also need to adjust the box position a little bit each time. You can do all of this at the same time with the <code>.set_bounds()</code> method, in which you specify the x position, y position, width, and height (so very similar to what you specify when you first created the box). Or you can do it in two steps, first setting the size and then moving the box appropriately.</li>
<li>If the box is not supposed to be shrinking and has a normal size, don’t do anything!</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have made those fixes, you should be able to play the game and have output very similar to the gif shown above. Once you have that, you can call me over and I’ll check you off!</p>
<h4 id="bonus">Bonus</h4>
<p>If you and your partner found the above particularly easy (but fun), then lets gamify this a bit further by adding a scoring system. Set up the necessary timer and callback so that the number of successfully clicked squares in 30 seconds is totaled. At the end of 30 seconds, the <code>step</code> timer should be stopped and the number of clicked squares displayed (either to the terminal or screen). What is the best you can do?</p>
