				<h2>Video HW Help</h2>
			</div>
		<h4 id="general-information">General Information</h4>
<p>This semester you will commonly have video homework problems assigned on Fridays which will be due the following Monday at midnight. This page is meant to provide some extra guidance and suggestions for how to go about creating these in a simple fashion.</p>
<h4 id="objectives">Objectives</h4>
<p>The process behind each video homework submission will likely entail the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading the given objective (Posted on the HW pdf)</li>
<li>Coming up with a problem that satisfies the objective</li>
<li>Solving the problem</li>
<li>Making a short (less than 4 minute) video describing your steps to solving the problem</li>
<li>Posting your video online</li>
<li>Emailing me with a description of your problem and a link to your solution</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="video-recommendations">Video Recommendations</h4>
<p>Videos do not need to be Hollywood blockbuster films! It is sufficient for you to write down your solution and then film yourself talking about it. I generally see a few different ways this could be done, and I describe them below.</p>
<p>I recommend you upload videos to Youtube for ease of use and viewing. Your Willamette account already will give you access, and you can upload files as unlisted if you don&rsquo;t want to make them public and shared with the world. The process is simple, just leave yourself enough time for the video to get uploaded! If you have any issues, by all means swing by my office and we&rsquo;ll get you sorted.</p>
<p>All below examples were done made from the following objective: <em>I can transform between position, velocity, and momentum vectors and relate them to physical observations.</em></p>

	  ytSrc="w1FOu-9YFnQ"
	  data-caption="&lt;h3&gt;Method 1&lt;/h3&gt;: In this method you just solve the problem in real time and talk about what you are doing. Very similar to a class-room lecture. Of the different methods, I think this is the most demanding as you have to ensure you are solving the problem correctly at the same time as talking about what you are doing."
  ></div>

	  class="vid youtube"
	  style="background-image:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2FffjuoHxIE/mqdefault.jpg"
	  ytSrc="2FffjuoHxIE"
	  data-caption="&lt;h3&gt;Method 2&lt;/h3&gt;In this method you write out the problem with all solutions beforehand, and then just film the content as you talk about it. I think this potentially came out as the best method, assuming your phone can record video. You can write out the solution either on a whiteboard or on paper."
  ></div>



<div
	  class="vid youtube"
	  style="background-image:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2kKy8WX7Org/mqdefault.jpg"
	  ytSrc="2kKy8WX7Org"
	  data-caption="&lt;h3&gt; Method 3&lt;/h3&gt;This last method will work if you don&#39;t have access to a video recorder, or of course you can use it if you just prefer this method. Take a picture of your solution, and then use your computer and some sort of screencast software to record you talking about the solution as it is on your screen. Screen-o-Matic seems to be a popular and free option for screencasting software."
  ></div>

<p>Also, allow me to recommend that you actually film horizontally so you don&rsquo;t look like such a total newbie like I did when I originally filmed these! :)</p>
<p>Also, speak up in your recording! It is a sad tale of how many times I&rsquo;ve had to sit with my volume maxed and my ear plastered against my speaker to be able to hear what someone is saying (and makes it pretty hard to also watch the video&hellip;). Play back your video before submitting it and make sure you are audible!</p>
<h4 id="example-of-past-submissions">Example of Past Submissions</h4>
<p>The below videos are some of my favorites from past students. They show a pretty wide range of how these can be done, way of explaining the problems, and general polish.</p>
