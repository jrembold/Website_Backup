<h2 id="getting-a-github-account-if-you-dont-already-have-one">Getting a Github account if you don&rsquo;t already have one</h2>
<p>Getting setup on Github is pretty straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate you way to <a href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a> and click on &ldquo;Sign Up&rdquo; in the upper right corner.</li>
<li>You should see a page like below, and can choose your own username, email, and password. These do not need to be affiliated with Willamette accounts if you do not want them to be, but make sure you have access to the email address.
<img src="GithubSetup.png" alt="GithubSetup.png"></li>
<li>On the next page, choose the free subscription plan.</li>
<li>On this last page, feel free to give Github some info on how you plan to use the account (or just skip this step).</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s it! You should be able to go ahead and sign in now.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="using-github-classroom">Using Github Classroom</h2>
<p>Github classroom has a central hub, located <a href="https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/54156918-cs-151-intro-to-programming-with-python">here</a>, where you can see all the current assignments and their deadlines. In general though, this will probably not be a page you need to visit very often.</p>
<p>More frequently, what will happen is each week when homework or some lab is posted, there will be an accompanying url. Following that url will bring you to a page that looks something like this: <img src="AcceptAssignment.png" alt="Accept assignment page"></p>
<p>When you accept an assignment, you will see a short loading screen at Github copies the necessary files and then you&rsquo;ll be faced with a screen like the one below. Here you can click the bottom link which will take you to your newly created (and private) repository where all your work will take place. <img src="ConfirmedAssignment.png" alt="Confirmation for new assignment">.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-and-using-your-repository">Navigating and Using your Repository</h2>
<p>In your repository you will see an exact replica of the folder structure and initial files I placed in that assignment. There will also always be a README which describes the requirements and guidelines for that assignment.</p>
<h3 id="downloading-assignment-materials">Downloading assignment materials</h3>
<p>To get the assignment onto your own computer, where you can edit the files. Click the green &ldquo;Clone or dowload&rdquo; buttom in your repository and then select &ldquo;DOWNLOAD ZIP&rdquo;. Once it downloads you&rsquo;ll need to unzip it to whatever location you like and can then proceed to edit the files. (Of course, if you are familiar with Git and want to use clone instead, by all means use that.) <img src="DownloadFile.gif" alt="Download file gif"></p>
<h3 id="uploading-assignment-materials">Uploading assignment materials</h3>
<p>You are free to use whatever editor or IDE you like to write files in this class (Spyder is probably the most obvious, but if you want to use VSCode or Atom or PyCharm, you are more than welcome to). Once you have made some edits to the file though, you will need to upload it back to your repository. The simplest way to do this is with the &ldquo;Upload Files&rdquo; button to the left of &ldquo;Clone or download&rdquo;. Doing so will bring up a new page where you should do several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag your file or select it through the file chooser</li>
<li>Add a short description of what you changed. A longer description can go in the space below that if necessary.</li>
<li>Commit directly to master branch</li>
</ul>
<p>And then hit commit changes! The folder view on Github will update immediately, so you can select the file if you like to make sure it worked. You&rsquo;ll also see the number of commits increase in the upper left. <img src="UploadFile.gif" alt="Upload file gif">
<strong>Note 1</strong>: In general you&rsquo;ll be editing existing files more often that uploading your own file from scratch. The process is the same though, and it will override the old existing file.
<strong>Note 2</strong>: I highly recommend to regularly upload the latest work you have, and to make meaningful commit messages when you do. The reason is two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Github serves as a form of version control, so if you ever really break something in your program, you can fall back to any commit you have made in the past and it will be &ldquo;exactly&rdquo; like you had it in that point in time. Your commit messages serves as your markers to decide what point you should roll back to.</li>
<li>Your repositories are private between just yourself and me. So at any point in time if you are having issues or struggling with something, I can see whatever your recent commits are. This can make it much easier to assist you remotely. I can&rsquo;t see things only on your local system, then need to be committed.</li>
</ul>
